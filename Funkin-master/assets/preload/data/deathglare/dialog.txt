:duplex-mad:Flux, back off. You've done this enough times.

:duplex-reg:Like, he went off alone with Gog and Perplex, and he came back! That doesn't just happen!
:duplex-mad:So you better step off right now. Or at least let him square up.
:flux:...
:quentin-reg:...
:flux:You're brave, huh?
:flux:Show me.
:duplex-reg:You got this, dude.
